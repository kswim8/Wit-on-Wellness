Wit on Wellness (WoW)
An Edutainment 15-112 Term Project by Keren Huang, intended to be the intersection of computer science and nutrition. It is a good app to teach the basics of nutrition through calorie counting and tracking macronutrients. The app offers a Sandbox Mode for free testing and goal setting, as well as a Puzzle Mode for practice with nutrition skills.

**Using the App**
Mode	        Function
Sandbox	      This mode is where you can experiment with different food plans and receive feedback on your diet based on your goals.
Puzzle Mode	  This mode is where you can try your hand at some puzzles related to calorie counting (easy) and food choice optimization (hard).
Instructions	There is an instructions page for each mode that discusses their functions as well.

**How to run the project**
Download the zip file, extract the files, and run the file called wit_on_wellness.py.
If you don't have the necessary modules, the module_manager.py (courtesy of CMU 112) file will cover the installations for you if you follow the steps in your terminal.

**Which libraries you're using that need to be installed, if any**
The following modules and libraries were used:
module_manager    : CMU-provided file for ease of installing new modules
cmu_112_graphics  : CMU-provided framework for built-in graphics and animations methods
random            : module for creating pseudo-random number generators
requests          : module for sending HTTP requests to the API to pull data
bs4               : module for webscraping and collecting images
json              : module for parsing JSON into Python dictionaries
nltk              : module for working with human language data, specifically Brown and food corpora

**A list of any shortcut commands that exist**
You can use the Esc key on most "pages" of the application to go back to the previous pages (this isn't explicit in the app, but it works on most modes).
You can test the Import Data button immediately with a prefilled text file (custom data).
